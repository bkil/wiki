# Fixing your dog #1

## Feeding

The holder should condition the dog to never accept food from other people than the holder and to never eat what they scavenge. They should only be fed at home manually at predictable times and in a designated area far away from the fence (e.g., from a dog bowl).

## Boredom

### Toys

It is advised that the dog have access to various chew toys both for solitary play and ones for play conducted by the handler. None of the chew toys should resemble everyday objects found around the house that may be mistaken for them.

The toys should vary in shape, texture, firmness, taste, smell and sound. They should be dog safe with no small part easily detached as a choking hazard. They should also be discarded once they have lost integrity.

To keep up the novelty, it is suggested to regularly get the dog an additional toy, at least once a month.

As dogs also have a personality of their own, it might happen that they may not like some of the toys or that they lose interested in some toys over time. Just give the toy away, swap it with another owner or get a new one.

### Resource guarding

Some dogs may exhibit resource guarding of certain items, such as food or toys. Aggression can be contained by conditioning the dog to drop the item upon command.

### Play area

In order for the dog to not mistake which items are allowed to be chewed and which are not, it is suggested that a well delineated and shady area is designated. Chewing should only be allowed within that area, and it should be prohibited outside that area.

All of the chew toys could be kept there.

This may also help if the pet has the habit of bothering the holder when they want to do solitary office work outside. Surely gardening could be an area where interruptions could be allowed.

### Destructive chewing

This behavior can be caused by various underlying problems addressed throughout this document. It is best to address all of the possible root causes instead of focusing on the symptom alone.

If the dog is found in the process of chewing on a forbidden item, the holder must immediately stop it with a disapproval yell (NO!) and optionally by commanding it to drop it.

Then the holder should take the dog to the play area and provide an average (but not rewarding) chewing toy to them and then praise the dog as it takes the toy in his mouth.

If the holder only finds the result of destructive chewing, it is not productive to yell in disapproval, because the dog will not be able to associate the action with the punishment.

The holder should praise the dog whenever seeing the dog chewing on its toys.

### Initiation

It is suggested that to maintain control, it should usually be the holder who initiates mutual play, not the dog.

## Stress

The dog seeks the proximity of the handler to cope with stress. Thus reducing stress is crucial for a stable pet.

### Predictability

The handler should maintain a stable schedule for both his activities and for those of the dog. This increases trust and reduces the agony of what happens next.

### Scent

The handler should regularly (wash and) manipulate by hand the toys of the dog so that they are charged with his scent. Chewing on the scent of the handler is more soothing to the dog than just chewing alone.

### Meeting new people

Studies have demonstrated that shelter dogs benefit from interacting with complete strangers. Thus it can prove beneficial to regularly meet new people.

To maintain the novelty of encountering strangers at home for a guard dog, it is advised to only meet strangers at predictable times and designated places away from home.

## Separation anxiety

Among a long list of further examples, the following are typical behaviors exhibited in connection with separation anxiety:

* destructive chewing,
* whining,
* digging or scratching at doors or windows,
* escaping.

Not all causes are well understood, but it can also be correlated with current stress levels along with traumatic events in the past.

### Fear

The level of novelty seeking vs. avoidance is a personal trait of a dog that also changes with time. A dog is greatly empowered by the presence of its holder. Hence after a move and possibly periodically, it is suggested that the holder should familiarize the dog with every aspect, every place and every noise nearby the new home. The dog will be less frightened as a result when left alone.

### Escaping

Escaping could be postulated to be driven by various mechanisms:

* dealing with a situation assessed as an imminent threat,
* boredom
* fear of its surroundings,
* an attempt to find the holder,
* scavenging for food,
* an unsuccessful attempt at soothing itself by revisiting the joy of walking with the holder outside in the past.

### Attention seeking

The dog may show attention seeking behavior in various contexts, such as in case of leaving.

The holder must never acknowledge this behavior. Acknowledging this behavior either verbally or with actions will only reinforce the behavior. The holder must especially never call the name of the pet from a distance when saying goodbye.

The behavior must not be punished, as that would also increase the stress level of the dog.

### Systematic desensitization

This method relies on exposing the dog to the absence of the owner to gradually increasing intervals of absence of the owner.

Predictability according to a schedule is even more crucial than otherwise.

Care must also be taken that the dog must not experience a traumatic event during this training, otherwise it must be restarted after a longer period of healing.

### Counterconditioning

The departure of the owner could be conditioned to be consistently associated with a positive outcome for the dog, such as giving a favorite toy, food or a treat.
